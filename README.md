## Notes:

#####Ruby Objects
* Everything is an object
* One always puts oneself in the place of an object and then has conversations with other objects, telling them to do stuff.
* One object "calls or invokes the methods" of another object. 
* Call a `method` on an `object` by placing a `.` after the object
* Invoking a method on an object inevitably generates a response. This response is always another object.
* One may also chain method invocations by simply adding more periods and method names sequentially

#####Ruby Methods
* Look up which methods an object provides by calling the `methods` method on it 
* `.methods` `.methods.sort`
* Invoke methods with arguments `.method(argument)`

#####Ruby Strings
