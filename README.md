# Creating a New Rails Project
Object-oriented interpreted scripting language: Ruby

This repository contains practice files.  These files were created to develop and learn Rails web application framework running on the Ruby programming language.

## Project: 
Create a simple blog (a Rails web application)

## Drivers: 
To learn the Ruby programming language and the Rails development framework.

## Technology:  
Ruby, Sqlite3, Rails, git, curl, RVM, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, libreadline6 -dev, zliblg -dev, libssi -dev,Sublime Text Editor, Terminal, Unix Command Line, Web browser

## Resources:
ruby-lang.org, guides.rubyonrails.org

## Notes:

#####Ruby Objects
* Everything is an object
* One always puts oneself in the place of an object and then has conversations with other objects, telling them to do stuff.
* One object "calls or invokes the methods" of another object. 
* Call a `method` on an `object` by placing a `.` after the object
* Invoking a method on an object inevitably generates a response. This response is always another object.
* One may also chain method invocations by simply adding more periods and method names sequentially

#####Ruby Methods
* Look up which methods an object provides by calling the `methods` method on it 
* `.methods` `.methods.sort`
* Invoke methods with arguments `.method(argument)`
* Special methods: `+   -   *   /   =   ==    !=    >   <   >=    <=    []`
* You don't have to use a period to invole them on objects
* `1+2`   # this is same as `1.+(2)`

#####Ruby Strings
* Literal forms:
* Anything surrounded with single quotes (') or double quotes(") as a string
* Call the `.length` method on a string to return its length
* String interpolation `#{}`
* Any valid block of Ruby code you place inside `#{}` will be evaluated and inserted at that location.
* A String literal created with single quotes does not support interpolation. 
* Search in a string `.include? 'String'` `.start? 'String` `.end_with? "String"`
* If a method is supposed to return true or false, we can end the method name with `?`
